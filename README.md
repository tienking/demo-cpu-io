This demo doesn't have process visualization.
All Arrived Time have default number is 0.
#Type of process input is seperated by ",".
#Ex: 3,2,4,5,1
#Choosing number of process will have seperate IO and number of process left will be general IO.
#Ex: 1,2,3 will say that process 1, 2, and 3 will have seperate IO
Enjoy.
